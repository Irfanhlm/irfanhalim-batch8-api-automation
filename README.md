I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Mas Ridwan for the exceptional guidance and support you have provided me. You have been an incredibly inspiring mentor, not only in terms of knowledge but also in my personal and professional development.

Thank you for taking the time to share your insights, provide direction, and always offer positive encouragement at every step of my journey. Everything I have learned so far would not have been possible without your presence as a patient and attentive mentor.

I truly appreciate every learning moment and experience I've gained, and I look forward to continuing to grow with the passion you have instilled in me.

Once again, thank you for all the help and mentorship you've given. I hope we can continue to collaborate and grow together in the future.

Best regards,
Irfan Halim
